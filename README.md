## Introduction

This code contains a sample application and a number of tests. This iteration also includes the solution to Exercise 3.

## Necessary Tools

There are a few things that you will need before you can get started.

* XCode - can be gotten from the App Store on your Mac or downloaded from [here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) (though this will just take you to the App Store anyway)

## Installation

To get the project ready to run on your machine, follow the steps below:

* Open a terminal. (Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows)
* Go to the directory where you want to place the code using [cd](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cd) for Windows, and it functions mostly the same for Mac. You just use "cd" but the folder structure on Mac is different (/Users/username/Documents instead of C:/Users/username/Documents)
* Copy the following command into the terminal, (remember, you must have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed)
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Manual-To-Automation-Sky/XCUITest-Lesson-3-Exercise.git.
```
* Move into the directory that you just cloned by typing
```sh
cd XCUITest-Lesson-3-Exercise
```

## Running Your Tests

1. Select the device as "iPhone 13 (15.2)"
